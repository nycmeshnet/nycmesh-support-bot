Slack chatbot to help with NYC Mesh support requests

## Usage

Use the included CLI to run the server like so:
```shell
supportbot-server
```

The server connects to the Slack API via websockets, bypassing the need for a public IP / port.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To install the `supportbot-server` command, do the following:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/andybaumgar/nycmesh-support-bot.git
cd nycmesh-support-bot/
```

A virtual environment is optional but recommended:
```shell
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Finally, install this package with
```shell
pip install -e .
```

### Prerequisites
You'll need `python` and `pip` to install this client. Confirm these are available with:
```shell
python3 --version
python3 -m pip --version
```

If not, install them using the appropriate instructions for your OS [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)


### Credentials

The bot needs Slack API credentials to operate. They are supplied in the .env file.

You can obtain credentials for a Slack workspace by creating a socket-mode app following
[these instructions](https://api.slack.com/apis/connections/socket).

### Usage

```shell
> supportbot-server
Starting bolt app...
Bolt app is running!
```

- `find . -name \*.py -print | entr -r supportbot-server`

### CLI Arguments

The `supportbot-server` command is configurable via a few CLI arguments. Use 
`supportbot-server --help` to learn more about the available options.

## Autoreload (Linux and Mac)
- install [entr](https://github.com/eradman/entr)

## Deploy Process

The supportbot uses GitHub Actions Docker and DockerHub for CI/CD. The [GitHub Actions workflow file](/.github/workflows/ci.yml) describes the process.

### Running with Docker

- install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- start Docker Desktop
- clone the repo and open a shell in the root folder
- ensure you have a .env file with all required credentials
- if you are running on Windows change the bin/nn_stats.sh carriage return back to LF (cloning on Windows will set it to CRLF, but this will not work in the Linux container)
- run the following commands:
```shell
docker build . -t supportbot
docker run --name nycmesh-support-bot --rm -v "$PWD/.env:/app/.env" supportbot
```

### Testing with Docker
 
- follow the directions above for running
- run the following commands:
```shell
docker build . -t supportbot
docker run -v "$PWD/.env:/app/.env" --rm nycmesh-support-bot-test pytest
```

### Dockerhub
Dockerhub is used as an image registry to store our built code before deployment.

### Secrets

Secrets are stored in GitHub Secrets, and locally in a `.env` file. In production a [script](env_json_to_dotenv.py) is used to convert the GitHub Secrets to `.env`.

### GitHub Actions/Runner setup

[Github Actions Self Hosted Runner setup description](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/adding-self-hosted-runners)

#### Starting and Stopping the Runner
An extra command is used to setup the runner as a service:
```
cd /home/supportbot/actions-runner
sudo ./svc.sh start
```
